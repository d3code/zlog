ZLog is designed to make logging in Go a breeze, providing you with a simple yet robust logging solution that integrates flawlessly with GCP and leverages the color capabilities of CLogs.

## Features

### 1. Zap Logger with Ease üöÄ

### 2. GCP Compatibility üåê

ZLog understands the needs of developers working in the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem. It comes with default configurations and integrations that make logging in GCP environments seamless. ZLog automatically handles authentication and log structuring, allowing you to focus on your application logic instead of the intricacies of GCP logging.
